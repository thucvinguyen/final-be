The dynamic tension of the band forces the core to stabilize the body and more closely matches the strength curve of the shoulder press. It can be performed in low reps, such as 5-8 reps per set, to build shoulder strength, or for higher reps to build muscle and for conditioning. It can work as the main focus of a shoulder day but is also popular as an accessory movement to the bench press or barbell military press.",

Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more.",
