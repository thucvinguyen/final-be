Most BFR workouts recommend using a far lighter weight than usual, perhaps as low as 25-50 percent of a normal working weight.",

When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit.",

Proper form is essential to really feel the burn in the glutes, and the ball can help guide you into the right form better than a bench, which is the usual support for hip thrusts. Unlike the bench version, the ball hip thrust is best performed with body weight or bands as resistance for safety reasons. It can be an excellent component of a warm-up for lower-body training, or a glute activation drill performed anytime.",

It is similar in form to a pistol squat, except that you sit to a box. This allows you to customize the depth of the movement to your movement abilities and mobility level. For this reason, the single-leg box squat is a popular movement for building leg strength in beginning trainees. It can be performed in lower strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per leg, or for higher reps for muscle building.",

      "description": "The dumbbell hang snatch is an explosive exercise that builds full-body power and targets the muscles of the hips, back, and shoulders. Performing the movement from the hang position, rather than from the ground, emphasizes explosive hip and upper-body power. It can be performed for low reps with a focus on power and speed, or for higher reps to build muscle or as part of a metabolic conditioning circuit.",

The surfer position offers a unique way to challenge the body by staying in a low position rather than standing up after the plank.",

The bar should actually come down behind the head. It is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper body or arms-focused workout. No need to chase a 1RM on this move!",
